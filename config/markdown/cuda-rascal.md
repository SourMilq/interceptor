## Blurb

CUDA is the Nvidia language for writing GPU kernels.
OpenCL is the equivalent open-standard language.
Neither CUDA nor OpenCL support multi-dimensional array access.
We are working to extend them.

For this mini-project you will extend the grammar of CUDA using the
Rascal Meta-Programming language. You will use Rascal to develop a
re-write system that translates our extended CUDA into regular CUDA.

Jackson Prange (ECE 3B) is working on the OpenCL side (he started on
this project last term).
You would do the mini-project on the CUDA side.
I personally wrote our original Rascal translator, so I know that this
is well within the scope of the external mini-project.

If you want to continue on this project for capstone, the point of
this language extension is to provide better data abstraction to
support automatic performance tuning of GPU kernels.

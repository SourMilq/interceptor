## Blurb

Blockchain-based platform with the capability to support a
customizable multi-factor block structure. Picture a master block with
a collection of nodes that are configurable with specific risk, or
compliance recipes relevant to the original master block content. This
changes the proof of work to a common valuation by groups of nodes and
provides a solution risk/compliance evaluation capabilities.

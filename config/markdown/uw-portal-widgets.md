## Blurb

The UW Portal team is creating a new SDK to facilitate student
development. It will be released to students for a hackathon on the
last weekend of October (October 29+30). SE390 students can get a
sneak peak of the SDK for their external mini-project and contribute
to improving the SDK for all of UW. You can count the hackathon hours
towards your external mini-project.

Expand Portal functionality by building and/or enhancing widgets using
the provided SDK, such as the crowd reporter, learn, library
integration, etc.

Do you enjoy gaming? Are you a fan of Roller Coaster Tycoon? Sim City?
Do you have a passion for the environment? What about city building?
Maybe you have thought at some point about how you would have built
your home town if only they had asked you, or somehow we could just
begin again.  

The wicked problem we're left with is how to minimize our impact while
also developing cities that are places that people want to live and
work as the drivers of our economy.  We need some way to bring all
these things together.

Our objective is to create a simulation style game that models the
impact of the land use and watershed management decisions we make as a
way to educate the public and crowd-source solutions to the problem of
urban development.

The game will allow for integration of unique city planning and
adaptive management styles to build a successfully functioning and
healthy watershed. Tradeoffs between stream health and city growth
will create a thrilling game experience, as developers strive to
complete challenges, grow population and the economy, and rejuvenate
degraded watersheds.

Could potentially be based on real geography (i.e., locations of
actual cities), or on fictional geography.

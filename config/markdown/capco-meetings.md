Somewhere up the management chain from Frank is Chris Ford, who is an
old classmate of Derek's. Derek and Chris never really knew each other
until fourth year when they were stuck together on a class project and
discovered they worked together really well.
SE2016 Team Persona had a successful collaboration with Capco.
If you are interested in finance, financial services, or consulting,
then the UW alums at Capco might be a good match for you.

## Blurb

Meetings as if every important moment was
captured effortlessly and in real-time. Why
should someone take their time and effort
taking notes, while they could be participating
in the real discussion? Use technology that
exists today to provide a software solution
with the capability of answering the following
questions: "Who is who?" and "What is
important?".

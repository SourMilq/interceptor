Hi Derek.  My name is Jackie Diebold, I am one of the co-founders of
FocusONCare, a company who's goal is to improve the lives of patients
undergoing cancer treatment. We aim to do this by creating a mobile
health care tool called ChemoTracker, and have spent the last couple
of years raising funds, networking, and performing field research. We
are still in search of a developer for our product and Prof Tom McFarlane
at the School of Pharmacy thought your software design capstone course
might be a good fit for us.

### Future: continuing
### Size: single
### Status: coding

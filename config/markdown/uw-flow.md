## Questions & Comments

Q1

C1 Some ideas (soushan):
1. Show which terms (Spring, Fall, Winter) in the previous year a course was offered. (unlike CS and SE, other faculties don't always say which term a course is offered, and having that historical data so you can plan would be nice)
2. Provide an easy way for people to report bad data (for example, for CS 343, there's a prof called kjjhh. Also, there are multiple Troy Vasigas)
3. Scape prof pictures from the Waterloo website (e.g. https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/people-profiles/derek-rayside-peng)

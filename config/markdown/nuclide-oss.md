## Blurb

Nuclide is the de-facto Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used at
Facebook, Inc. It is an open-source project built as a collection of packages
on top of Github's "Atom" text editor that give it IDE-like functionality. This
includes tooling support for remote development and source control, as well as
special language considerations for Hack/PHP, React Native, and JavaScript.

Most developers at Facebook work on pre-existing codebases. For the most part,
there is no necessity to create a new repository.  For this reason, no effort
has been placed into supporting functionality allowing new projects to be
created within the IDE.

Our objective is to create an extensible "New Project" wizard, allowing users to
create a new templated project with starter code. This would be extensible, allowing
other users and Nuclide developers to define "templates" for projects, allowing for
different customizable project types. This would greatly benefit open source usage
of Nuclide and could be used to boost usage and awareness of features like Flow, a
static type system for JavaScript with amazing Nuclide support (really, click-through
definitions, a class/method outline view, autocompletion, and more!) and Babel, a JavaScript
transpiler. Both of these usually require some setup that could easily be automated by
the new project wizard.

Knowledge of JavaScript is not necessary but would be greatly helpful in working on
this project, as less time would have to be spent in learning the language and could
instead be invested in getting up to speed with the codebase, the Atom package infrastructure,
and the software development practices observed by the Nuclide team.

Update: Made [post on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues/815).

NOTE: We're looking for 3-4 students total, including me (schitley). Please contact me
if you want to commit to the project. The goal is to have this entirely shipped, so you'll
have to be willing to work >8 hours a week!

### Future: continuing
### Size: single/multi
### Status: coding

There is only one specific Nuclide proposal here --- just one team.
But other teams could make other contributions to Nuclide.

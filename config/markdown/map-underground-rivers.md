_Andrew Chan,_ 3rd year Planning Student  
Currently creating a spreadsheet of underground rivers
from the urban planning research literature --- so far 35 entries are in the database.

## Blurb

Create a database with a web front-end connected with Google Maps for
underground rivers in cities around the world. Collaborate with prof
and students from UW School of Urban Planning. This database is
intended to become the premier global resource for data on underground
urban rivers, and is part of a long-term research project that is just
getting started.

_Why are there underground rivers in cities?_ Cities are typically built
near large bodies of water, such as Lake Ontario, the Saint Lawrence
River, or the Atlantic Ocean. Large bodies of water are fed by smaller
streams. As cities grow, they want to build where those little streams
are. But you cannot just remove the stream: water is coming from
somewhere, and it needs to continue on its way. So you cover it up and
build over it.

_Why build a database of these underground streams?_ A variety of
research and planning reasons. One of the main driving factors is that
people are discovering the environmental and civic benefits of
uncovering these streams --- which is called _daylighting_ them.  For
example, these streams can better handle storm overflows when
uncovered, which helps protect cities from big storms, which are
increasing in frequency and intensity due to global warming.  Read
more about daylighting streams in Ontario here:

_Competitor:_ There is one competitor to this project, based in the
UK. Your challenge is to be better.

_Getting Started._ This long term research project is just getting
started. You have the opportunity to shape the long-term technical
direction. Get involved at the beginning!

GIS (Geographic Information System) options include:
* Google Maps
* The UW Map Library system
* QGIS https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QGIS
* Some other established system? Mandy will know more.

Database engine options include:
* PostGRES / MySQL
* [Neo4J Graph Database](https://neo4j.com/) --- a river is not a point
* ???

### Future: continuing
### Size: single?

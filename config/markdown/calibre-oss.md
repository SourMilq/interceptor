Note: This is not an open feature request, so I don't know if it will be accepted.
Note 2: This project is of uncertain difficulty. It could be too hard or too easy.

calibre is an e-book manager. It can view, convert, edit and catalog e-books in all of the major e-book formats. It can also talk to e-book reader devices. It can go out to the internet and fetch metadata for your books. It can download newspapers and convert them into e-books for convenient reading. It is cross platform, running on Linux, Windows and OS X.

Currently, calibre can convert PDFs to EPUBs, but the text reflow is basically Select All, Copy, and Paste.
Although it has a lot of heuristics to detect the text flow, it doesn't handle PDF drawing commands very well.
This completely breaks stuff like equations and tables.
It would be nice if the PDF input plugin were improved.

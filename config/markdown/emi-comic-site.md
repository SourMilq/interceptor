Emilia (Emi) is a self-employed artist who often creates art outisde of  
commisions to attract clientele. Often posting these to social media  
and streaming herself drawing commisions and free art requests on twitch.tv  

Emi is interested in getting a website up with focus on webcomics  
and possibly for displaying her other artwork aswell  

## Blurb

The primary focus of this site will be to not only present webcomics  
but also allow Emi to easily upload them to the server along with captions/titles/alt-text/etc.  

#### Additional Possible Goals Include:
* Some method of feedback by means of a favourite button and/or possibly leaving comments
* Fill newsfeed from social media accounts
* Search functionality
* Embed Twitch stream
* TBD...

Here is a very simple mockup of the site  
note: will not look exactly like this

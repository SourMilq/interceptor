# Tab Destroyer

## The Issue
- Tab management is difficult.
- Oftentimes, the list of open tabs grows until it becomes unwieldy.
- This is problematic for two reasons:
  - High memory consumption
  - Degradation of workflow efficiency

## Solution
- Build a Google Chrome extension that uses heuristics to eliminate unneeded
  tabs:
  - It can also recognize things like if the same url is open more than once and
    some specific amount of time has passed, it can remove duplicates.
  - After a certain time, we can kill all tabs that have websites whose root domain is the same.
  - It can try to figure out if nothing has rendered on a page, and it's blank.
    And some specific time has passed out, it can remove that tab.
  - Remove multiple new tabs, if more than one are open.
- We can pick and choose the heuristics we want to use.
- Other potential features to improve the experience of using tabs:
  - A toggle switch that groups tabs that are playing music or share other
    similar properties. It can provide keyboard shortcuts.

This is not an external project: there is no external person and there
is no external code. This is an internal project: your own idea that
you wanted to start coding from scratch. We had an opportunity for
that kind of experience for course credit last time around. Now it's
time to get involved with the external world.

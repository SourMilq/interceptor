Today's online applications depend on fast storage and retrieval of
up-to-date data at Web scale. To meet this growing demand, the
designers of distributed storage systems have devised a rich variety
of data replication protocols, offering different trade-offs between
consistency, latency, and availability.  Understanding the sweet spot,
and testing whether a system delivers a particular level of
consistency, are challenging problems as consistency itself is
difficult to reason about. This software project aims to construct a
tool for measuring consistency empirically, which can strengthen
confidence in the correctness of storage systems and the optimality of
their configuration.

This project involves working on the following open source codebase:

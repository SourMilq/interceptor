# Index of External Mini-Project Proposals

## Process

The external mini-project is intended to be a transformative
experience: to introduce you to new ideas, new problem domains, and
new people, that you might not have imagined at the beginning of the
term. From experience I have noticed that some students are very
conservative, and make strong efforts to stick with ideas and people
they know. The point of school is to learn new things. Be open to the
opportunity.

1. Express interest in multiple projects by editing the Markdown files. 
    * By October 16.
1. Form teams with other students who have expressed interest in
   projects that you are interested in.
    * Do not constrain yourself to work only with people you already
      know. Recall that the evaluation for the external mini-project,
      as for the internal mini-project, is based solely on your
      individual effort. This is the best low-risk opportunity you
      will ever get to learn something new.
    * By October 19, with some grace if there are delays due to
      interactions with outside parties or other good reasons.
    * Use the project interest graph and summary table below to help
      you make decisions between the multiple projects that you have
      an interest in.
    * You cannot refuse someone to join a group who has an interest in
      the project without some good reason. A good reason might be
      that the group already has six people.
1. Once you have solidified your team, remove your interest from
   the other projects. By following this process, eventually each
   student will be associated with just one project.

## Project Interest Graph

_Meaning:_ A node for each project. Edge between projects indicating that there
are students interested in both projects. Dotted edges mean there is
one common student; regular edges mean a few common students; bold
edges indicate many common students.

_Interpretation:_ Some project proposals have more students who have
expressed interest than can work on the project (_oversubscribed_).
Some project proposals need a few more students (_undersubscribed_).
The under/over-subscription distinction is not perfectly captured in
the graphs below because some projects can support multiple teams (see
table below).

## Glossary for Project List
* _Terminal:_ This project has no potential for a capstone project.
  It's just an external mini-project. This is a good choice if you are
  truly confident that you want to do something else for your capstone
  project.
* _Continuing:_ This project has potential to be a full capstone
  project. You should be open to this possibility, although you are
  not committing to it now.
* _Multi:_ This project could have multiple teams working on it.
* _Single:_ This project has room for only one team.
* _Interested:_ A count of the number of students who have expressed
  interest in the project. 
    * There need to be at least 3 interested students to form a team.
      Less than 3 means the project cannot go forward --- unless
      possibly there are external collaborators, which should be
      discussed with the SE390 instructor.
    * Maximum team size is 6 for capstone projects. Could go up to 8
      for external mini-project if really necessary.
* _Question Mark:_ Indicates that the data are not known with
  certainty. This is the current best guess.

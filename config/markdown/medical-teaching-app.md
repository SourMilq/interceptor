_An email posted to the MIT Computer Science and Artifical Intelligence
Lab (CSAIL) mailing list (below). I (Derek) have contacted the author (Sunny),
and they are interested in the possibility of collaborating with UW
students (although they were initially targetting MIT students)._


My name is Sunny Varshney, and I'm a 3rd year internal medicine resident at
Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. I'm working on a medical education project
with my residency program director. We are trying develop a mobile app to
help teach medical students the physical exam in a more interactive,
durable way.

We have most of the content we would like in the app already, but need an
app developer to code the app and create a user interface with us. Work on
this project would span at least this academic year, and could possibly
extend to the 2017-2018 academic year. The project is ideal for someone who
has a passion for education and/or medicine, but I would be happy to hear
from anyone interested.

Please email me directly at: avarshney1@partners.org if you are interested
or have further questions. Funding is currently being obtained, and we
could work out financial compensation and also consider having this project
count towards academic credit if there is interest.

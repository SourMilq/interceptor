Contribute to Ohm: A library and language for building parsers,
interpreters, compilers, etc.

Ohm is a parser generator consisting of a library and a
domain-specific language. You can use it to parse custom file formats
or quickly build parsers, interpreters, and compilers for programming
languages. The Ohm language is based on parsing expression grammars
(PEGs), which are a formal way of describing syntax, similar to
regular expressions and context-free grammars. The Ohm library
provides a JavaScript interface (known as Ohm/JS) for creating
parsers, interpreters, and more from the grammars you write.

## Blurb

DuckDuckGo is an open source search engine that lets interested programmers provide
answers to popular web searches at the top of the list of results using their
Instant Answers API. This is similar to Google's OneBox.

We would like to contribute by creating our own Instant Answer for the project.
The team is generally quite responsive and open to new pull requests.

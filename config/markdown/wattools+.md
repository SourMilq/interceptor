## Blurb

Wattools is a platform for collection of tools for University of Waterloo students, built by University of Waterloo students.  The original version is built in PHP by Viktor Stanchev, and extended with Python by Kyle Lexmond. However, currently the site is just a static web page so the tool submission is by Email, which is slow and inefficient. The current user interface is a long one page website.
We want to extend the site with proper Microframework, add a database, add an admin module and improve the UI. Some functionalities like upvote/ downvote, report dead site, are being considered too.

## Blurb

Make an online database of past SE Capstone projects that can be
conveniently browsed and queried in a number of ways. Extract data
from LaTeX files. Tag projects.

### Future: terminal

This is just an external mini-project for one team. There is no possibility to
continue this on for a full capstone project. There isn't enough work
to do. 

### Size: single team
### Status: coding

There is only enough work for one team.

## Questions & Comments

Q1 mwrahman: Is there a central repository that holds all the latex files for previous capstone projects?

A1 drayside: Yep, it's the Subversion repo that we are using. At least
that has the last few years. Some previous years were in
course-specific repos, but I can migrate them to this one.

Q2 mwrahman: Should the user be allowed to submit capstone projects through a web interface?

A2 drayside: Nope, not required. This is just intended to be for SE projects. We
have the skills to edit text files in a version control system.
There's nothing wrong with building a web interface for editing
Subversion files, as Github has, but it's really beyond the scope of
this project.

Q3 arajeev: How many years worth of SE Capstone projects do we need to store?

A3 drayside: We have the abstracts for SE2012 to SE2016 in compiled
PDF form, for your perusal, in a subdirectory of the Handbook:

https://ecesvn.uwaterloo.ca/courses/se_capstone/handbook/abstracts

The earlier years there were before I started teaching SE491, so I had
to extract those abstracts out of other documents and compile the
PDFs. This collection might be complete for every SE project ever
done: I'm not sure exactly what the first year of capstone/FYDP was,
but it wasn't much before 2012.

## Blurb

The idea is to build an open-source clone of chffr, which is a dashcam
video / GPS / IMU data collection app for Android. The app would be
used to crowd-source an open-source database of driving data for
training self-driving cars. A nice extension would be to also provide
a CAN data recorder using a cheap off-the-shelf bluetooth-enabled ODB
plug.

The data would be used to develop and validate self-driving cars. It
would support the Waterloo Autonomous Driving program's objective to
achieve driving on K-W residential-area streets by the end of 2017 and
driving to Toronto on 401 by the end of 2018.

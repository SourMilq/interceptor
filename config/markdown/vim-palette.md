## Blurb

There's no easy way to go experiment with many color schemes in Vim. Users
currently have to install colors manually and type

  :colorscheme solarized

We want to create an interface for users to easily try out new Vim color
schemes, caching all colors while also managing the installed colors.

The interface would look similar to NERDTREE, a popular Vim Plugin, with a list
of colors on the side. Users can hover over any color scheme with their cursor
which would change the colorscheme.

### Future: terminal?
### Size: single
### Status: rejected
This is not an external project: there is no external person and there
is no external code. This is an internal project: your own idea that
you wanted to start coding from scratch. We had an opportunity for
that kind of experience for course credit last time around. Now it's
time to get involved with the external world.

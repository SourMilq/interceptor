Somewhere up the management chain from Frank is Chris Ford, who is an
old classmate of Derek's. Derek and Chris never really knew each other
until fourth year when they were stuck together on a class project and
discovered they worked together really well.
SE2016 Team Persona had a successful collaboration with Capco.
If you are interested in finance, financial services, or consulting,
then the UW alums at Capco might be a good match for you.

## Blurb

Banking as if you were at a branch
anywhere/anytime of the day. A Bot awaits
for you to ask it things like "How much money
do I have in my Savings account?", "Give me
a direct deposit form", or "Where am I
spending too much money?" Information,
graphs, and even interfaces are easily
presented to the customer at their
convenience.

Tendai is interested in doing a startup in the digital education
space. This specific idea is how Derek taught his son Pi on Pi day
this year. It's a good introductory project for October.


## Blurb

Create a tablet (e.g., iOS) app for teaching Pi to grade one students.
This is not about the decimal expansion of Pi but, rather, about the
geometric concept. Children this age do not know about decimals and
fractions, and anyway some prefix of the decimal expansion is not
intellectually important. For these children, 3 is a reasonable
approximation of Pi. 

Educational material available online (at least what Derek has found),
including Khan Academy, is inadequate for teaching Pi to children this
age. Here is an approach that worked for at least one five year old,
and perhaps could work for others if it was made into an app that
parents could use with their children.

0. Take a picture of the celebratory pie. The parent must bake or
purchase a real live edible pie before using this app. Use the picture
of the celebratory pie as a reward for making progress in the app.

1. Squares. How much longer is the distance around the square than the
length of one of the sides? (They don't know the word "perimeter", but
could be introduced to it in a sidebar.) Form a hypothesis. Write it
down in the app. Now do experiments: 

    - Allow the user take a picture of a square object.
    - Then they cut a string that wraps around the object. Take a picture of that string laid out straight.
    - The software rolls the square along the string four times, until it reaches the end of the string.

    Now we know the ratio for squares: 4.

2. What is the ratio for circles? Will it be more or less than for
squares? Form a hypothesis. Write down the hypothesis in the app.
Repeat the string measuring experiment above with a number of circular
objects --- including, importantly, the celebratory pie. Make a data
table for these objects and measurements. Observe that the value is
always a tiny bit more than three.

    Twist: use quantitative measurement (i.e., centimetres or inches),
    rather than just relative measurement with strings. Then the child can
    do some arithmetic in computing the ratio. They don't know division,
    but they do know addition: keep adding the diameter until the sum is
    close to, but not over, the value of the circumference. How many times
    do we do the addition?

    Was the hypothesis confirmed or refuted?

3. It's not three, it's not four: what is it? Pi. Show the Greek
letter Pi. This is the special name for this number that is more than
three but less than four. A little more than three, a lot less than
four. Show the English word "pie". "Pi" and "pie". These are
homophones: same sound but different spelling and different meaning.

    Allow the child to trace out the shape of "Pi" and "pie" on the
    screen.

4. Eat the celebratory pie! Take a picture of the child eating the
pie.

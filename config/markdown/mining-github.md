_Motivation:_ We want to determine is a software project (among the
miilions of projects on GitHub) is an engineered project or not. One
of the factors which show that a project is engineered is the presence
of some kind of architecture in the software. There are already some
tools that extract very detailed architecture from the source code.
But they take time and cannot be applied to the millions of projects
on GitHub. Hence, in this project you will build a hierarchical tool
that will quickly decide if a software project has some design behind
it and how much of design there is.

_Definitions:_ Software architecture is the high-level structure of a
software system that depicts the relationships between various
components that compose the system. Software architecture comes in all
shapes, sizes, and complexities. There is no one fixed architecture to
which all software systems adhere; however, software systems that
employ some form of architecture have discernible relationships
between components that compose the system. These components can be as
granular as functions and as coarse as entire binaries.

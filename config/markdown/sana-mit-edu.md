Sana is an open source software platform from MIT to facilitate
healthcare delivery in the developing world.

Sana advances a unique multidisciplinary integrative approach to
improving global health: leveraging technology to overcome resource
limitations, focusing on analytics to drive evidence-based quality
improvement, and an educational program for capacity building to
promote locally sustained innovation.

Sana has active deployments with doctors and nurses around the globe.
They also run hackathons with engineering students around the globe.
Finally, they teach a graduate course at MIT/Harvard on global health
in the winter term that some UW SE students have taken remotely (from
UW) as a technical elective.

UW SE students have successfully collaborated with the Sana team for a
number of years, on a variety of projects in three main areas:

* Sana Mobile [SE2013]
* Sana Protocol Builder [SE2016 + SE2017]
* Sana PCHR (Health Records) [SE2017]

There are projects available in these areas and more. The Sana team at
MIT has proven that they can work well with UW SE students.

UPDATE FROM KENNETH PAIK 2016-10-19:

The project opportunity lies with the Sana Protocol Builder and it's extensions in integrating with the overall Sana Mobile Platform. The Protocol Builder was initially developed by a group of University of Waterloo students as a tool to allow clinicians to build the mobile client scripts which guide mobile users through the data collection process. The project has seen significant advancement since its inception but would benefit greatly from further work to include extending it to the full set of features available in the mobile client scripting engine, distribution of the generated scripts to the mobile clients, and further optimization of the user interface based on more extensive user testing with clinicians.

A current student team is working

The specific extensions that your team could work on could include:
1) Android Development: Protocol synchronization
2) Android Development: Updating the protocol interpretation engine
3a) Web: Application skinning module
3b) Android Development: Application skinning module

Ultimately, the project scope and deliverables would depend on your team's skills and interest and we would be able to adjust expectations around those.
We would be glad to arrange a follow up call to detail what the features and functions include.

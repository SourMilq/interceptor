# Mentorship from Alumnus Startup Flipp.com

## Blurb

Flipp.com (formerly Wishabi.com) is a Toronto-based startup founded by
UW Engineering Alumnus. They now have about 300 employees.  Their main
product is online flyers. They have expressed interest in being
involved with your capstone projects. They have made positive
contributions to some UofT student projects in the past. 

This is a new kind of direction for us. Let's see how it works if you
are interested. Individual employees of Flipp.com have expressed
interest in mentoring your projects in areas of their expertise.
That's a bit more open-ended than we are usually targetting for
October, but maybe it will work well.
